# Software Engineering

- Language: Java
- Goal: Complementing an existing public transport application with finding the best route between two stations based on different preferences (least stops, least changes, shortest time).

### Details
- Implementation of sort-of Dijkstra-algorithm.
  - See in hw-2023-WonderWarner-hu\subprojects\maps-model-util\src\main\java\org\openmetromaps\maps\Navigation.java
- Making tests and static analysis.
  - See in $Test$ folder
- Extra task was to use LLMs to generate implementations and tests and reviewing their work based on each others tests.
  - Documentation in $Extra$ folder
- For using the program a gtfs folder is needed with routes, stops, etc.
